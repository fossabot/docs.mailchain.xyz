# Running the Application

## Serve

After you have configured your account\(s\), and any other steps required for the protocol you will be sending messages with, you are ready to start the application and the api.

To start the application, run:

```bash
mailchain serve
```

_When prompted enter the same passphrase as when you added the account._

You are now ready to start sending and receiving mails. Navigate to [https://inbox.mailchain.xyz](https://inbox.mailchain.xyz) to see your mailbox.

The Mailchain web interface has all the functionality needed to send and receive messages. It's easy and fun to use. For more information on switching between protocols and networks, see [Mailchain Web Interface](mailchain-web-inbox/mailchain-web-interface.md).
