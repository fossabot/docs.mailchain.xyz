# Getting Started

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to install Mailchain onto your machine. Then we’ll setup the application to send, then receive messages.

Installing Mailchain is easy:

* First, you install the application onto your local machine. See [Installation](installation.md) page for details.
* Then you’ll add a private key to send and receive messages. See the appropriate instructions for setting up [Ethereum](ethereum-instructions/) or [Substrate](substrate-instructions/).
* Then, you can then navigate to the web interface [https://inbox.mailchain.xyz](https://inbox.mailchain.xyz) and start working.
